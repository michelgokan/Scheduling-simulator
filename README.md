# OS533_Scheduling_Simulator
This project aims to compare 
Completely Fair Scheduler algorithm(Linux scheduler) with 
two other scheduling algorithms: 
1. First Come First Serve
2. Priority Scheduling. 

The project implements:
1. Completely Fair Scheduler algorithm modified for simplicity
2. First Come First Serve algorithm
3. Priority Scheduling

Language Used: Python 3.6

To run the project:
1. Import the downloaded source code in a suitable environment(Pycharm IDE preferred)
2. Make sure the project is compiled successfully by downloading all the required dependencies.
3.Before running the project, make sure that the current directory is same as project directory
4. To run the project use the below command in the terminal:
    python Simulator.py -n 10 -t 4
    where n --> no of jobs
          t --> CPU time slice
